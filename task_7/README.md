Task #7 (the last before the course project)

You may consider this as an optional task, I know that many of you are still working on the previous problems. It's OK if you didn't complete some tasks. You will have additional time after the project defense.

Use your stack.

Create a Web application without registration and authentication. At the start user just enters its name (just name without password or anything).

The task #7 does not have "detailed requirements": just create multiplayer gaming platform with at least two games — tic-tac-toe game (required) and any other game you want, e.g., Reversi or Battleship (for 2 remote players — but many games can take place at same time between different pairs of users). User selects game type creating a game session and opponent can choose a session to connect. 

Make it cool, make is easy-to-use, fun-to play.  Imagine that you want to sell this app or use it for your portfolio.

Of course, player should get an opponent's move straightaway (without page reload). Please, note that you should implement REMOTE games, not just the draw a field for two players at the same computer.

PLEASE, TRY TO MAKE IT AS A "NICE PROJECT" — IMAGINE THAT THIS IS NOT A LAB PROJECT, BUT YOU ARE TRYING TO GET SOME INVESTMENTS FOR YOUR STARTUP. Make it "sellable".
