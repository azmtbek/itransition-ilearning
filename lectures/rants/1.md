It's a great idea to test edge cases â€” some arguments/parameters/states/etc. For example, zero number of arguments when arbitrary number of arguments are expected, empty array, empty string, min/max values of your types, values less/greater than supported min/max, etc. And, of course, null value. 

It doesn't mean that corresponding checks should always be explicitly placed in your code. Explicity is good thing, but, of course, sometimes you may overcook your vegetables. 

If in doubt, add a check.

About overcooked vegetables. Let's say you have something like this:
```python
def method(arg):
    arg.implementation()
```

Do you really need to explicitly check the arg value for the None (or null, or nil, or undefinedâ€”choose your poison) before the call a method on it? Not really.

But in general, the idea about edge case checks is a good one.
