Why admin should be able to delete or block itself? Let's say you develop and configure some sensitive application, e.g. banking software. After you've completed your work, you must remove yourself at least to be able to prove in the court that you were  not able to steal money from the bank, e.g. using account deletion record in audit logs of a database.

Why does the slider have a range from 0 to 10, and the field from 0 to 1000? They are connected. Shouldn't the values be the same?

Because these are different controls. The slider allows you to quickly set the value in a small range. The input field allows you to enter an exact value in any range, but it is slower. They solve the one task together, so they are connected.

This is a fairly typical solution when there is a different probability of choosing values in different ranges - users more often choose a small number of errors, 0, 1, 2, or 3, and only occasionally they need to specify 100 or 200. Making a slider with a range from 0 to 1000 is pretty useless, the users won't be able to "hit" 1 or 2. They will be able to quickly drag to some value close to 300, for example 313 or 299, but selecting 2 with such a slider will be very difficult, and we assume that a small number of errors are needed more often.

So that's why:

```javascript
slider.value                               ===> field.value
Math.min(field.value, SliderMaxValue = 10) ===> slider.value
```
